# Collection of Greasemonkey Scripts for Backup Purposes

## Repair Escapist
Enables autoplay on load, unmutes the audio, randomly plays a new video on complete.

## Repair Novel Pages
Injects options into Novel Planet's page to remove unnecessary content
Currently removes: Unicode characters, Leftover Ad whitespace, Translator/Editor notes.
The primary focus is on the Notes, I keep expanding on the regex to try have it encapsulate everything but this may not be feasible.
